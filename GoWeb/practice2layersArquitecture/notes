Architecture

Layers :

- controller : receive client request, validate values, run services and
  return an answer.

- service : core application functions and administrate external resources like and external api or data base(data persistence)

- repository : data access.

Project structure

we can do it in two different ways :

- layers ( controller, repository, service )

- domain by actor : who take part of my system ( employee ( controller, repository, service) products ( controller, repository, service))
